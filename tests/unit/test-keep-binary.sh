# Unit test for the Tailscale binary keep list (unit K1). A firmware upgrade that keeps settings
# copies every path a /lib/upgrade/keep.d list names that exists, so the binaries must be listed
# only while a Version Manager binary is installed:
#   - src/upgrade/keep.d/gl-tailscale-fix no longer names /usr/sbin/tailscale(d);
#   - src/scripts/ts-fix-update writes a second list,
#     /lib/upgrade/keep.d/gl-tailscale-fix-tailscale, when it installs a binary (install_binary ->
#     keep_write) and removes it on Restore, and --sync-keep converges it on what is installed;
#   - pkg/postinst runs --sync-keep after its sysupgrade.conf migration;
#   - pkg/postrm removes the second list on a real removal, never on an upgrade.
# Laptop only, no router involved:
#   sh tests/unit/test-keep-binary.sh [root]       (also runs under: busybox ash)
# root defaults to the repo. Another tree with the same four files at the same relative paths can be
# given instead, e.g. the pre-change baseline tests/results/20261003-build/baselines/pre-K1/, which
# must fail.
#
# The updater is SOURCED with TS_FIX_UPDATE_LIB=1, so the cases bind to shipping code; its library
# guard returns before the mode dispatch. A copy without that guard line ahead of the dispatch is
# never sourced, and every behavioural case then fails. Every path the updater writes or reads is
# pointed into a temp dir: TS_BIN, TS_DAEMON, TS_INIT, ROM_PREFIX and KEEP_BIN by the environment
# overrides it reads at load, LOCK, STATUS, CACHE, PLUGIN_CACHE and SYSUPGRADE_CONF by assignment
# after sourcing. The install leg (case e) tests install_binary, the function do_install calls once
# the download is verified, plus a static check of that call's place in do_install: do_install
# itself downloads to a fixed /tmp path, so it is not run here. pkg/postrm is run with its paths
# rewritten into the temp dir (linted first); pkg/postinst is checked statically. do_restore (case
# d) always runs under busybox ash, whatever shell runs this suite: its `exec 200>"$LOCK"` is a
# multi-digit fd redirection, which BusyBox ash (the router's shell) accepts and dash reads as a
# command named 200.
#
# The fakes, linted in case 0 before any case relies on them:
#   tailscale  fake_ts writes an executable that records its arguments in $T/ts-calls and prints
#              the given lines (a real `tailscale version` prints the version on line 1 and commit
#              lines after it); fake_hang one that execs a 30 s sleep; fake_fail one that writes to
#              stderr and exits 1.
#   timeout    a shell function recording its bound in $T/timeouts and running the command under a
#              real 2 s bound, so a hang leg costs 2 s, not 10.
#   logger, sleep, mv
#              shell functions recording their calls ($T/log, $T/calls, $T/mvlog); mv then runs the
#              real mv, sleep does not sleep.
#   the service TS_INIT names an executable fake recording "init <args>" in $T/calls.
# The four functions are written once to $T/fakes.sh and sourced both here and by the busybox ash
# driver, so the definitions case 0 lints are the ones every case uses.
